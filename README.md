# MixTape is a simple project to record http interactions and replay them offline for testing

This is a simple side project inpired by [go-vcr](https://github.com/dnaeon/go-vcr/tree/v3) project
which in turn was inspired by the ruby based [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) project.
I wanted to create a very minimal version of the said package since I want to use this in my other projects
which are based on some http interactions and testing them end to end would result in a non-deterministic results.
Hence the inception of this project.
